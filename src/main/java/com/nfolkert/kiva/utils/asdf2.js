He started by buying and selling of goats right away. Most butchers have known his business, so a number of them come to him to buy goats.<br><br>He can now buy and sell between 15 and 20 goats in a month -- a great amount.<br><br>The market is very open since most of Ugandans rear goats and cows for raising money whenever needs arise like school fees, sickness, death, journey etc.<br><br>Onyango has attended business training and he is capable of handling the loan and paying it back.<br><br>Given a loan of 500 US dollars, he is targeting to introduce bulls for slaughter and opening up a butcher shop himself.
